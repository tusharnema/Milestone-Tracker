# Milestone-Tracker

A product for CL Media where It acts as a bridge between academia and Industry.
Basically it is built on the concept that many potential projects are being done by the students in high school and college but they do not get the desired sponsers and the stand they deserve for implementing it on a vast scale or real life. Similarly many giant corporates are looking for feasable projects that can be implemented as their products to create a impact in the society basically creating a win-win situation for both The industry and students.

It's a bridge that joins both of them in the most interactive way possible.
